NP: Solution can be verified in polynomial time.  
NP-Hard:A problem is NP hard if is is as difficult as any NP problem.  
NP-Complete: If the problem is both NP & NP Hard.

TSP is NP: need to verify in polynomial time that given solution is optimal? which isnt possible in polynomial time.  
TSP is NP-Hard: All other problem in NP class can be reduced to it in polynomial time.  
TSP is NP_Complete?: Is the given tour shorter than L
