NP: Solution can be verified in polynomial time.  
NP-Hard:A problem is NP hard if is is as difficult as any NP problem.  
NP-Complete: If the problem is both NP & NP Hard.

TSP is NP: need to verify in polynomial time that given solution is optimal? which isnt possible in polynomial time.  
TSP is NP-Hard: All other problem in NP class can be reduced to it in polynomial time.  
TSP is NP_Complete?: Is the given tour shorter than L

  **Hall's Theorem**  
  It gives a necessary and sufficient condition  for a matching to be possible.  
  For u,v barpartite graph,  u >= v  
  i.e. any node in u should have >= more choice then any node in v.

  **KÅ‘nig's theorem**  
  Maximum matching is equal to minimum vertex cover.  
  Minimum vertex covers =minimum vertex by which every edge is touched upon.

  Matching is maximum if and only if no augmenting path exists.
